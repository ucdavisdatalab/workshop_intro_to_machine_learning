# Supervised Learning

Classification refers to modeling categorical variables. Classification models
can provide insight into the relationship between the predictors and response,
as well as a way to make predictions about new observations.

This chapter provides an overview of popular classification models, and then
delves into the details of actually using them. We'll cover how to choose a
model, how to partition data into training and test sets, how to use
cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters, and how to evaluate the
performance of models in R. We'll also explain some strategies you can use to
improve model performance.

After this workshop, learners should be able to:

* Build and train a classification model on their data.
* Use cross-validation to estimate accuracy and tune hyperparameters for
  classification models.
* Identify strategies to improve results from classification models.
