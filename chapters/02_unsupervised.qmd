Unsupervised Learning
=====================

Clustering involves identifying groups of similar observations (called
clusters) within data. Clustering can be an effective tool for finding patterns
and an important part of exploratory data analysis.

This chapter presents the advantages and disadvantages of several popular
algorithms for clustering, as well as examples of how to run clustering
algorithms in R.
