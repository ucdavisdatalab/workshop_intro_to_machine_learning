Classification models can provide insight into the relationship between the predictors and response, as well as a way to make predictions about new observations.\nThis chapter provides an overview of popular classification models, and then delves into the details of actually using them. We’ll cover how to choose a model, how to partition data into training and test sets, how to use cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters, and how to evaluate the performance of models in R. We’ll also explain some strategies you can use to improve model performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\nAfter this workshop, learners should be able to:\n\nBuild and train a classification model on their data.\nUse cross-validation to estimate accuracy and tune hyperparameters for classification models.\nIdentify strategies to improve results from classification models.",
