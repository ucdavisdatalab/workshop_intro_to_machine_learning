We’ll cover important terminology and popular methods so that you can determine whether machine learning is relevant to your research and what to learn more about if it is. This is a concept-focused, non-technical chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\nAfter this workshop, learners should be able to:\n\nDefine the following terms: observation, feature, machine learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, training set, validation set, test set, cross-validation, overfitting, underfitting, model bias, model variance, bias-variance tradeoff, ensemble model.\nExplain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.\nExplain the difference between regression and classification.\nList and briefly describe popular machine learning methods.\nGive an example of an ensemble model.\nExplain what cross-validation is used for and give an overview of the procedure.\nAssess whether and which machine learning methods might be helpful for a given research problem.\n\n\n\nReader",

Classification models can provide insight into the relationship between the predictors and response, as well as a way to make predictions about new observations.\nThis chapter provides an overview of popular classification models, and then delves into the details of actually using them. We’ll cover how to choose a model, how to partition data into training and test sets, how to use cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters, and how to evaluate the performance of models in R. We’ll also explain some strategies you can use to improve model performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\nAfter this workshop, learners should be able to:\n\nBuild and train a classification model on their data.\nUse cross-validation to estimate accuracy and tune hyperparameters for classification models.\nIdentify strategies to improve results from classification models.",
